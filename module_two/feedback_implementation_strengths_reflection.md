# Feedback III Reflection

* What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator? && How do you use your strengths as a team member?
The feedback I have received aligns with my strength finder results.  I take care when making decisions (this helps plan projects). I am a relator who cares about being open and honest.  Generally, I am more objective and logical over emotionally responsive.  This has helped keep drama low and efforts focused on the work.
Based on the feedback I received, I am a capable, intelligent partner who is good at communicating without being aggressive or egotistical.

* How would you like to continue to develop your strengths?
Whenever we have covered the strengths finder, my take away is that I am comfortable embracing/leaning into my strengths.  

* What would you like to improve on as a teammate? 
Another thing that stands out is that I need to continue working on my emotional engagement.  I can have the tendency to focus too much on the logic and not enough on the human interactions.

* How would you like your teammates to see you?
The Jahari window exercise highlighted pretty well where I stand and aligns with where I would like to be:
Collaborative
Intelligent
Logical
Responsible
